    "### Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large number of investors\n",
    "- New information arrives randomly\n",
    "- Prices adjust quickly\n",
    "- Prices reflect all available information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Origin of information\n",
    "\n",
    "- Price/volume (public, rapid, quick, everyone can see it)\n",
    "- Fundamental (reported quarterly, everyone can see it, public)\n",
    "- Exogenous: information about the world that affects company (e.g. price of oil affecting airline stock)\n",
    "- Company insiders (may or may not be legal, acting on information inside company not yet public)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 forms of the EMH\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weak: future prices cannot be predicted by analyzing historical prices (leaves room for fundamental exploit)\n",
    "- Semi-strong: Prices adjust rapidly to new public information (can only make money based on insider information)\n",
    "- Strong: Prices reflect all information public and private (can't exploit market)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is the EMH correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strong: no, insiders make money, some of it illegal\n",
    "- Semi-strong: There is evidence that EMH is incorrect, P/E (10-year) ratio vs 20-year annualized returns show trends"
